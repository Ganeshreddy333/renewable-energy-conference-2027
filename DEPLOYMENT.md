## 🏗️ Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- MySQL (local or managed)

### Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install
```

2. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.local
```

3. Update `.env` files with your local/cloud credentials

4. Run database migrations:
```bash
cd backend
npm run migrate:deploy
npm run seed:admin
```

5. Start development servers:
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Frontend: http://localhost:3000
Backend: http://localhost:3001

## 🐳 Docker Compose (Local)

For testing containerized setup locally:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

**Note**: This uses local MySQL. For production, use a managed MySQL service or your preferred hosting provider.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

See [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](./DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) for common issues and solutions.

## 📞 Support

For platform-specific issues:
- Render: https://render.com/docs
- Vercel: https://vercel.com/docs
- MySQL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/
- Cloudinary: https://cloudinary.com/documentation
- Resend: https://resend.com/docs

If your Docker install uses the legacy Compose CLI, run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Before production use, change:

- MySQL passwords in `docker-compose.yml`
- `JWT_SECRET`
- `FRONTEND_URL`
- frontend build arg `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`

## Health Check

The API exposes:

```text
GET /health
```

Expected response contains `status: "ok"`.

## Deploying Separately

Backend:

- Install dependencies with `npm ci`
- Set `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, `FRONTEND_URL`, and `API_PORT`
- Run `npm run migrate:deploy`
- Run `npm run build`
- Start with `npm start`

Frontend:

- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to the deployed API origin
- Run `npm ci`
- Run `npm run build`
- Start with `npm start`
